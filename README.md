# Interpreter from [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours] (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)

I started this tutorial as a way of solidfying my rudimentary
understanding of Haskell acquired by reading **Learn You a
Haskell for Great Good!** (LYAHFGG). The real goal was to push
past it, getting to a point where I'd be reading, understanding,
and writing real code.

The Parsec library introduced in Chapter 2 proved to be a great
way of doing just that. I found Stephen Diehl's [NanoParsec library](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/002_parsers.html) most
helpful in acquiring an understanding of parser monads, which
made it much easier to later look at the Parsec
[source code] (https://github.com/aslatter/parsec) itself.

Dissecting the Parsec library is also a very good way of beefing
up your understanding of Monads, and I found the Understanding
Monads [chapter] (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_monads) of the Haskell Wikibook to be a very helpful
supplement for **LYAHFGG**.
